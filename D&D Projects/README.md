This section is for a personal project for a desktop app for automatically rolling dice for Dungeons and Dragons.
It is currently only able to be done via CLI. GUI's are not the most fun thing to make lol
I am working on finding a character sheet that saves the stats in JSON or similar format to avoid inputting stats every time. 
Stats do vary depending on character so I'm avoiding preset variables.

Once I find a working JSON character sheet, I will set the python script to run creating a small GUI with a button that will run each function for Saving Throws, etc. and display the result.
